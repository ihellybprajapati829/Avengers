                Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) were always emotionally connected because they were
                both entangled with an Infinity Stone called the Mind Stone. Wanda was exposed to it when she was being
                experimented upon by HYDRA, and Vision had it living literally inside his head.
                Living idealized suburban lives, super-powered beings Wanda and Vision begin to suspect that everything
                is not as it seems.
