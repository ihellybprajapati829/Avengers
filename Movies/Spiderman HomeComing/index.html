                Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, young Peter Parker returns home to live with his Aunt May.
                Under the watchful eye of mentor Tony Stark, Parker starts to embrace his newfound identity as
                Spider-Man. He also tries to return to his normal daily routine distracted by thoughts of proving
                himself to be more than just a friendly neighborhood superhero. Peter must soon put his powers to the
                test when the evil Vulture emerges to threaten everything that he holds dear.
