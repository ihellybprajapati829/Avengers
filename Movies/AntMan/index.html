                Forced out of his own company by former protégé Darren Cross, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits
                the talents of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a master thief just released from prison. Lang becomes Ant-Man,
                trained by Pym and armed with a suit that allows him to shrink in size, possess superhuman strength and
                control an army of ants. The miniature hero must use his new skills to prevent Cross, also known as
                Yellowjacket, from perfecting the same technology and using it as a weapon for evil.
