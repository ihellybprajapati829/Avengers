                After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his
                rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king and as
                Black Panther gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the
                entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release
                the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.
